\item{\textbf{Spot hidden} mist on the floor}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section*{HW}
\large
\begin{itemize}
\item{Mist thicker here and covers the floor.  It is coming from 3 tanks supplying something (liquid nitrogen perhaps) to some bodies on the tables.}
\item{HW stands at end in front of 3/4/5/6 (as appropriate) ``super zombies''}
\item{Upon entry he does his speech; ``So, the time has come for people to come sniffing around huh?''\\\\ ``For years this facility has enabled me to do my work unhindered, and by bribing a few prison guards I was always guaranteed the freshest possible corpses, sometimes I could even get hold of them during their last few hours of life.''\\\\  ``The guards' greed and unfathomable lack of curiosity was the key to my success.  Since the prison closed rumours have spread and it appears I won't be able to finish my work despite being so close to a breakthrough which would benefit all mankind.''\\\\  ``Unfortunately however I am afraid you must die in order for me, Herbert West - Reanimator - to make a clean escape and continue my work elsewhere...''}
\item{Begins injecting corpses with some serum}
\item{During combat, party notice that the floor is a false floor; a viewing area in the middle reveals failed re-animations writhing below}
\item{As the battle progresses one of the nitrogen tanks falls through weakening the floor, it all starts to crack}
\item{If required, \textit{bats} can fly out when this crashes through}
\end{itemize}

\section*{End}
%Getting into the boat to escape, you feel like something is piercing your head, look back and see what appears to be a mummy wearing a detective overcoat.
\large
\begin{itemize}
\item{HW keels over, ``You fools... I was within a whisker of providing immortality to benefit us all...''}

For ``Burn'' roll luck.  Failure means catch fire, doing 1 HP damage each combat round.  Roll on floor to put it out (unless zombie).\\\\
On a flamethrower fumble roll \textbf{D6}; 1-3 fires wrong direction, 4-5 stalls for \textbf{1D3} rounds, 6 starts hissing and will explode in \textbf{1D2+1} rounds.

\subsection*{Skill vs. skill}
Used for e.g., stealth vs. listen
\begin{itemize}
\item{If both parties fail, nothing happens}
\item{If one party succeeds, the successful skill is accomplished}
\item{If both succeed, the highest roll wins}
\item{If the rolls are tied, highest skill value wins}
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Resistance}
Used for e.g. rolling STR against SIZ, or DEX vs DEX with equal MOV
\begin{itemize}
\item{Roll active (e.g. STR) against passive (e.g. SIZ)}
\item{Active on top}
\item{Passive down side}
\item{Cross-ref that number}
\item{And roll D100 equal to or less}
